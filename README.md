Robo Friends

Robo Friends is an interactive web application that displays a list of robot cards with their names and email addresses. Built using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React, this app allows users to search through the cards to find robots by name. The application features a scrolling interface and dynamically renders the list of robots as you type in the search bar.

Features

Interactive Search: Start typing in the search bar, and the app will dynamically filter and display only the robots whose names match the input.
Dynamic Rendering: The list of robots updates in real-time as you type, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.
Scroll Functionality: The app includes a scrollable interface to easily navigate through the list of robots.

Technologies Used

JavaScript: For the application logic and functionality.
CSS: For styling the components and layout.
HTML: For the structure of the web page.
React: For building the user interface and managing the state of the application.

Usage

Open the application in your browser.
Use the search bar to find robots by their names.
Scroll through the list to view all available robots.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
